# Git dotfile, globally configuring git for the current user.

# ....................{ INCLUDES                          }....................
# List of the absolute or relative paths of all files conforming to the syntax
# of this file to be imported into this file, defined as one "path" entry for
# each such file. Note that "path" entries:
#
# * Are silently ignored if not found.
# * Prefix relative paths by the absolute path of the directory containing the
#   current file.
# * Expand a prefixing "~/" to the home directory of the current user.
# * Do *NOT* expand environment variables (e.g., "${HOME}").
# * *MUST* be absolute or relative paths; shell glob syntax is *NOT* supported,
#   excluding the aforementioned "~/" expansion.
[include]
    # Absolute path of the user-specific git configuration file defining all
    # "[user]" credentials for the current user. For security, credentials are
    # sequestered into a non-world-readable file *NOT* published to GitHub.
    #
    # The contents of this file should resemble:
    #
    #     [user]
    #         name = <ENTER NAME UNQUOTED HERE>
    #         email = <ENTER E-MAIL UNQUOTED HERE>
    path = ~/.gitconfig.d/user.cfg
