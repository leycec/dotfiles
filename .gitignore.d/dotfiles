# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Whitelist all files and subdirectories of the current directory matching the
# following git-specific glob expressions.
#
# --------------------( CAVEATS                            )--------------------
# Whitelisting files or subdirectories of top-level subdirectories requires
# whitelisting those subdirectories first. See the ".gitignore.d/" whitelist.
#
# --------------------( SEE ALSO                           )--------------------
# For further details, see:
#
# * "man gitignore" for high-level commentary.
# * "man 7 glob" for low-level commentary on glob syntax. Note, in particular,
#   that glob() and hence ".gitignore" files support only a proper subset of
#   bash- and zsh-style glob syntax.
